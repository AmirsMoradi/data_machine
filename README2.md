# üè° Residential Property Price Prediction using Random Forest
Project Summary
This project documents the development of a highly accurate machine learning model to forecast residential sale prices in Ames, Iowa, using the comprehensive Ames Housing Dataset. Our final solution utilizes a Random Forest Regressor combined with meticulous feature engineering to capture the complex, non-linear dynamics of the real estate market.

The project successfully elevated the predictive accuracy from a basic Linear¬†Regression R 
2
  of 0.75 to an outstanding final score, confirming the model's robustness and reliability for valuation tasks.

## üéØ Model Performance: Final Results
The final Random Forest model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

Key Metrics Summary
R 
2
  (Coefficient of Determination): 0.9146

Interpretation: The model explains 91.46% of the variability in house sale prices. This performance is an increase of +9.18% over the best linear model.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): \$17,474.95

Interpretation: On average, the model's predictions are off by just $17,475.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): \$26,502.70

Interpretation: This low value confirms the model effectively minimizes the impact of large prediction errors (outliers).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology and Feature Engineering Pipeline
The significant jump in accuracy was driven by moving from a simple linear model to a sophisticated, non-linear ensemble method, supported by strategic data preparation.

1. Model Implementation Details
Algorithm Used: RandomForestRegressor

Rationale: Selected for its superior ability to model complex, non-linear relationships and its robustness against data noise and outliers compared to linear methods.

Split Strategy: train_test_split (80% Train, 20% Test)

Target Variable (Y): SalePrice

2. Strategic Features Driving Accuracy
The following features were critical in achieving the high R 
2
 :

Quality & Size Factors:

Gr Liv Area, Overall Qual, Total Bsmt SF, Full Bath, Garage Cars.

Locational Premium:

Neighborhood (Crucial for modeling location-based price premiums).

Temporal Feature:

HouseAge (Engineered by calculating 2010‚àíYearBuilt for better capture of depreciation than the raw year).

3. Data Processing Techniques
Categorical Encoding: The Neighborhood feature was processed using One-Hot Encoding (pd.get_dummies) to convert categorical names into a format usable by the model.

Data Integrity: Rows with missing values in the selected critical features were removed.

## üìà Visualization: Actual vs. Predicted Prices
The final model's performance is visually represented by the scatter plot below. A high-performing model is characterized by data points clustering tightly around the diagonal red line.

The narrow spread of the blue dots around the red line confirms the Random¬†Forest model's low residual error and high confidence across the price spectrum.
